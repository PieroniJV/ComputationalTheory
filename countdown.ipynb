    "### The Countdown Game\n",
    "#### Description of the Game: \n",
    "\n",
    "Countdown is a British game show involving word and mathematical tasks that began airing in November 1982. [1](#gameshow). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the numbers version of this game, contestants are given *six random numbers* from the list containing *two copies of the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive* and *one copy of each of the numbers 25, 50, 75, and 100.* A *random integer is generated between 101 and 999 inclusive.* The contestants are given *30 seconds* to reach the target number using as many of the six numbers as they need using *addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few restrictions to the game, such as:\n",
    "- **Each of the six numbers can be used only once** (Two of the same number might be in the list of six, in which case each copy can be used once).\n",
    "- **The operations can be used any number of times**, however, division is only permitted where it results in a whole number - no fractions are allowed at any stage of the calculation. Likewise, subtraction can only be used when it results in a positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Examples: \n",
    "Provide a few examples of the game to illustrate how it is played.\n",

    "### Approaches to Solving the Game\n",
    "#### Algorithmic Strategies: \n",
    "Discuss various algorithmic strategies that can be applied to solve the game, such as brute force, dynamic programming, and heuristic methods.\n",
    "#### Optimal vs. Practical Solutions: \n",
    "Explore the trade-offs between finding the optimal solution and a practically sufficient solution within the time constraints.\n",

    "#### Literature Review: \n",
    "Summarize research findings related to solving number games like Countdown and their computational complexities.\n",
    "#### Relevance to Broader Computational Problems: \n",
    "Discuss how the strategies for solving Countdown can be applied to other computational problems."
