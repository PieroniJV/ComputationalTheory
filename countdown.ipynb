    "- Goals:\n",
    "    - Identify difficult computational problems in everyday computing.\n",
    "    - Define the common models of computation.\n",
    "    - Design computer programs using a variety of computational paradigms.\n",
    "    - Analyze the complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project:\n",
    "    - Analyse and solve the numbers round of the TV program Countdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The countdown game:\n",
    "    - Contestants are given six random numbers from the list containing two copies of the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive and one copy of each of the numbers 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n",
    "    - A random integer is generated between 101 and 999 inclusive.\n",
    "    - The contestants are given 30 seconds to reach the target number using as many of the six numbers as they need using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "    - Each of the six numbers can be used only once. Two of the same number might be in the list of six, in which case each copy can be used once.\n",
    "    - The operations can be used any number of times. However, division is only permitted where it results in a whole number - no fractions are allowed at any stage of the calculation. Likewise, subtraction can only be used when it results in a positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm:\n",
    "    - a Python function called solve_numbers that takes any such list of six numbers and a target number, and returns at least one solution if it exists. In some cases, a solution might not exist, in which case the function should return None or your function can return a calculation that is within 5 on either side of the target number - the closer, the better.\n",
